Mapping is the process of defining how a document, and the fields it contains, are stored and indexed. For instance, use mappings to define:
    which string fields should be treated as full text fields.
    which fields contain numbers, dates, or geolocations.
    the format of date values.
    custom rules to control the mapping for dynamically added fields.
