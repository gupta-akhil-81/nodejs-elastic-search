    You can use the search_after parameter to retrieve the next page of hits using a set of sort values from the previous page.
    The Scroll api is recommended for efficient deep scrolling but scroll contexts are costly and it is not recommended to use it for real time user requests. 
    The search_after parameter provides a live cursor. The idea is to use the results from the previous page to help the retrieval of the next page.
